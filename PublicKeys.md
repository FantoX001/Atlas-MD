### 🎀 Mods( Must be added ):
- Mods are the people who can use `mod` commands like: `ban`, `unban`, `mute`, `unmute`, `add`, `remove` etc.
- In other works they are Maintainers of the bot.
- You can add multiple mods by separating their numbers with `,` like: `94753527022,94774516277` etc. where `94` is country code and `753527022` is phone number. ( Do not use international format like: `+94 753527022` or `+94753527022` etc. And also do not use `0` before country code like: `094753527022` etc.)
